## Install
With npm, use the familiar syntax e.g.:
```shell
npm install @reduct/logger --save
```

once the component package is installed, just require it in your application file.
```js
const propTypes = require('@reduct/logger');
```

This package also supports AMD/RequireJS. Aren't using AMD or CommonJS? Just grab a [release](https://github.com/reduct/logger/releases), include the `Dist/Logger.min.js` and access the logger via the following global:
